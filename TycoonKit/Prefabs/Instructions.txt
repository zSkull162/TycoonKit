1. Drag the Essentials prefab into the scene

2. Drag any of the other prefabs in after

3. Make sure to check the script of any prefab after you drag them in, and set up the Money Manager, or Audio Source reference if needed.

Unless specified, some references aren't required. For example, you don't have to add an audiosource to the buttons, if you don't want a sound to play, and you don't have to add text components either, if you don't want it to display the name or cost.

Everything is also networked, for in-instance and late-joiners. Technically the droppers and currency objects aren't synced, but they'll be dropping at roughly the same time for everyone anyway, so you shouldn't notice.

Everything should magically work, as long as no references are missing.
